## Introduction
HolidayBuzz-ContentClassifier efficiently categorizes social media images into six holiday-related categories using advanced Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Designed for social media platforms, it aids in enhancing user engagement and targeted monetization through intelligent identification and spotlighting of holiday-themed content. With robust and accurate classification, it is a valuable tool for leveraging festive seasons for better user interaction and revenue generation.

## Installation & Setup
Clone the Github repository: git clone https://github.com/Kalazclint/HdayBuzz-ContentClassifier.git
Install the required Python packages: pip install -r requirements.txt

## Project Structure
- Data Preparation: The project started with data importation and preprocessing, where images were matched with their classes from a CSV file.
- Data Augmentation: A data generator was used to apply transformations for better generalization.
- Model Architecture: Several architectures were explored, with a significant focus on CNNs and ResNet.

## Model Architectures
1. Basic CNN Model: A simple Convolutional Neural Network with layers for feature extraction and classification.
2. Enhanced CNN Model: A more complex CNN with added layers and batch normalization for better performance.
3. ResNet: A deep residual network was implemted to further improve classification accuracy

## Training & Evaluation
Models were trained using the specified datasets and evaluated based on their accuracy in classifying test images into the correct categories.

## Issues & Solutions
- Data Loading: With a large dataset, loading all images simultaneously could be inefficient. Using data generators helped in efficiently loading batches of images.
- Model Complexity: Adding more layers sometimes led to issues with the input size. Adjusting the architecture or removing pooling layers in deeper networks resolved this.
- Training Speed: To improve the training speed, one could consider using hardware acceleration, optimizing the architecture, or employing techniques like transfer learning.

## Future Directions
1. Advanced Architectures: Consider exploring architectures like ResNet-101, ResNet-152, or even architectures like EfficientNet.
2. Transfer Learning:  Use pretrained models like VGG16, ResNet50, etc., and fine-tune them on the dataset to improve accuracy and reduce training time.
3. Hyperparameter Tuning: Use techniques like grid search or random search to find the best hyperparameters for the model.
